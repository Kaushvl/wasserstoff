 LLM + RAG for Wordpress site selling widget? 






    Question | Help
  








    I run a Wordpress website that sells products, let’s call them widgets. The widgets are sold via an affiliate program and it would be cool to be able to harness a local LLM / RAG on my web server to let the visitors say something like:
  
    What’s the advantage of widget ? Can you list 3 widgets with X for $20 I’m going to the Olympics, what widget do you suggest I use?
  
    You get the picture. I have a FAQ sections, some blog articles and perhaps a link to the widgets in a database via an API.
  
    I’ve been playing around with AnythingLLM and OLLAM on my base 2021 M1 Mac. AnythingLLM allows RAG and I’ve uploaded a scrape of my website as the RAG. It seems to work ok, a little slow and sometimes not very accurate. So my question is would it be possible to run this setup on a remote server, I’m currently on a cheap Linnode plan so it most defiantly does not have a GPU or enough horsepower? Do any all in cost effective solutions existing right now?
  
    I’m thinking this is not ready for prime time yet due to cost if one wants to use a 3rd party LLM via API or the horsepower needed to run a server that can handle a few queries a second??? My commissions are piss poor at $1 per transaction so this is probably a deal breaker right now.
  
    I realize that in a couple of months in this fast moving AI space we’ll probably have a Wordpress plugin and a subscription for $10 pm!
